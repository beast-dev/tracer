To improve the visual appearance on Mac OS X this program attempts to load the updated Look & Feel from the VAqua project. This is loaded at runtime and the binary jar file is included here for convenience when building Mac binaries.

VAqua is open source with contributions from multiple sources using multiple licenses. The Aqua look and feel code and original contributions are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 with a linking exception (commonly known as the Classpath exception).
